        # BRIEF INTRODUCTION

    The presented project represents my implementation of
an asynchronous WINDOWS web server using I/O Completion Ports and
Overlapped I/O.

    The server has a basic functionality of only fetching
various demanded files (static of dynamic files).
    The static files are transfered via zero-copying using
the TransferFile and the dynamic files are transferred using
overlapping WSASend as we suppose that the server needs to
do some operations on the said file.

        # IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

    The server works as a state machine, presenting the following
states:

    STATE_INIT:              The connection is initialised and
                                 is waiting to receive the HTTP request

	STATE_DATA_RECEIVED:     Request received, next step is to manage
                                 the header of the response

	STATE_DATA_SENT:         The demanded file was fully sent

	STATE_DATA_PENDING:      File is beign transmitted

	STATE_DATA_HEADER:       The next step for this connection is sending
                                 the response's header

	STATE_CONNECTION_CLOSED: Connection closed due to an error or due to
                                 the file beign fully sent


    To achieve the asynchronous behaviour, there are 3 overlapped structures
for each connection:
        -> For receiveing
        -> For sending
        -> For reading from the file (for dynamic files)

    The connection_complete_socket_send() function takes care of every
connection's next step by taking into consideration the connection's
current state and the type of the demanded file.

    Every connection's work is scheduled by making use of the
overlapped I/O with completion routines API.
    
    The communication between the server and it's clients is done
via sockets, thanks to the wsock32 socket library for Windows.


    For further implementation details, the code is wsock32
thoroughly commented.
